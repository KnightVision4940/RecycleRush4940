<h2 align="center"> 4940 GitHub Workflow - Abridged </h2>

<h2 align="center"> How to Use GitHub</h2>
+ This is a <b>Repository</b>, or a <b>repo</b>. This is a folder of sorts that all our code will be stored in.
+ Whenever you change the code, you <b>Commit</b> the code to the repo. This way we can keep track of all the changes in the past and revert to them if anything goes wrong.
+ There are different <b>Branches</b> within the repo. These branches are a like the branches of a tree, with each growing out from the main branch, in this case called the <b>master</b> branch.
+ When you want to work on a part of the code, <b>create a branch</b> with your name, the issue you're working on, and a short and descriptive name based on the changes you plan on making within it. Then, <b>commit your changes to the branch</b>.
+ When you feel your code is ready to go and complete, send a <b>Pull Request</b> of your branch. This will allow the rest of the team to look over and discuss the changes. If it looks to be completely functional, Stew will <b>Merge</b> the branch into the master.
+ Remember to check out the <a href="https://github.com/KnightVision4940/FRC-2015/wiki">wiki</a> to find some important information, and to report/review <a href="https://github.com/KnightVision4940/FRC-2015/issues">issues</a>.

<h2 align="center"> Stew's Rules of GitHub </h2>
+ Please make sure your commit name and description are <b>descriptive</b>, and it is clear what happened on that commit.
+ Do NOT commit directly on the master branch. Create a branch with your name and the issue number you are working on, and commit there. When you are sure it is complete and functional, send a pull request to add it to the master branch.
+ Do not merge pull requests automatically. Either Stew or other team members will look over the pull request before merging it.
+ No unfinished code on the master branch; any code in the master branch should be able to run on the robot at anytime.
+ No spam or non-subtle jokes in the code
+ No flaming or abusing in here
+ Have fun!
